# Django-for-Everybody-Specialization-Course-Work-and-Projects
The "Django for Everybody Specialization" certificate is offered on Coursera by the University of Michigan. It is awarded to those who successfully pass all the tests for the four courses of the Specialization.It is an amazing course which you can find here: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/django

# This Repository
This repository contains my own personal coursework throughout the whole Specialization. It starts small and adds up progressively to the final project which is a complete (back-end wise) CRUD web application. Therefore, there will be some code snippets carried over here and there. As well as some personal notes and sketches, feel free to ignore those :)

Some files may contain code from examples as well as some trial and error and are not 100% my own code (examples, obviously) but could be useful to look at for a new learner. However, Any “Assignment” code is my own personally written code which I used to pass the course tests. At the Time of me taking this course, django version 3.4 was being used in the course material and in the course tests. Feel free to use any of this code as you wish.

The full on “CRUD Assignment” is the "ads" project. Which is a web app that allows different users to list different Ads which can be viewed by all other users. However, only the owner of each Ad can manipukate it. This is the overarching example that most of the course material builds up to. The website is actually functional and hosted freely, courtesy of pythonanywhere.com, if you would like to check it :)

Front end elements are sparse mainly because Front-End design is not really the main goal of the course. Just utilizing HTML elements withing the django environment using its template engine.  

# About The Specialization
This specialization introduces Python programmers to building websites using the Django library. Across the four courses, you will learn HTML, CSS, SQL, Django, JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON Web Services.  During the course, you will build online websites using Django and those working websites are graded throughout the course. This series is  excellent preparation for learning other ways to build web applications using technologies like PHP (Web Applications for Everybody), Flask or Ruby on Rails.  This is a great first course in any web development curriculum.
